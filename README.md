## Udacity FrontEnd Nanodegree Neighborhood Map
This application shows parks in a specific area. Displayed on a map using Google Map API, it shows the current weather on the location by a third party API, openWeather.org. 
I build the app with HTML, JavaScript, CSS, KnockOut framework and jQuery.

## Run App 
- [Here](https://github.com/NatalieCyreus/parkMap) is the project folder. Download or clone the files. 
- Unzip the folder and run index.html file to open it in a browser.
